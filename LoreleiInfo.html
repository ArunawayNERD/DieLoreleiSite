				The Lorelei (also spelled Loreley) is a rock on the eastern bank of the 
				Rhine near St. Goarshausen, Germany, which soars some 120 metres above
				the waterline. It marks the narrowest part of the river between Switzerland
				and the North Sea. A very strong current and rocks below the waterline 
				have caused many boat accidents there.Lorelei is also the name of a
				feminine water spirit, similar to mermaids or Rhine maidens, associated
				with this rock in popular folklore and in works of music, art and literature.

				In 1801 German author Clemens Brentano composed his ballad Zu Bacharach am 
				Rheine as part of a fragmentary continuation of his novel Godwi oder Das 
				steinerne Bild der Mutter. It first told the story of an enchanting female
				associated with the rock. In the poem, the beautiful Lorelei, betrayed by
				her sweetheart, is accused of bewitching men and causing their death. Rather
				than sentence her to death, the bishop consigns her to a nunnery. On the 
				way thereto, accompanied by three knights, she comes to the Lorelei rock. 
				She asks permission to climb it and view the Rhine once again. She does so 
				and falls to her death; the rock still retained an echo of her name afterwards.
				Brentano had taken inspiration from Ovid and the Echo myth.
				<br /> 
				<br />
				In 1824 Heinrich Heine seized on and adapted Brentano's theme in one of his
				most famous poems, Die Lorelei. It describes the eponymous female as a sort
				of siren who, sitting on the cliff above the Rhine and combing her golden
				hair, unwittingly distracted shipmen with her beauty and song, causing them
				to crash on the rocks. In 1837 Heine's lyrics were set to music by Friedrich 
				Silcher in a song that became well known in German-speaking lands. A setting 
				by Franz Liszt was also favored and over a score of other musicians have set 
				the poem to music.
