				The Rhine is a river that flows from Grisons in the eastern Swiss Alps
				to the North Sea coast in the Netherlands and is one of the longest and
				most important rivers in Europe, at about 1,233 km (766 mi), with
				an average discharge of more than 2,000 m3/s (71,000 cu ft/s).The Rhine 
				and the Danube formed most of the northern inland frontier of the Roman
				Empire and, since those days, the Rhine has been a vital and navigable 
				waterway carrying trade and goods deep inland. It has also served as a 
				defensive feature and has been the basis for regional and international 
				borders. The many castles and prehistoric fortifications along the Rhine 
				testify to its importance as a waterway. River traffic could be stopped at 
				these locations, usually for the purpose of collecting tolls, by the state 
				that controlled that portion of the river.

				The Rhine is one of the longest and most important rivers in Europe.
				Until 1932 the generally accepted length of the Rhine was 1,230 kilometres
				(764 miles). In 1932, however, the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon 
				stated the length as 1,320 kilometres (820 miles), presumably a typographical
				transposition error. After this number was placed into the authoritative 
				Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, it became generally accepted and found its way into
				numerous textbooks and official publications. The error was discovered in
				2011, and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length as 1,232 kilometres
				(766 miles).
